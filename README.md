# SQL-portfolio
Hello! thank you for checking out my repository containing solo projects for data analysis using SQL, and their visualisations using Tableau.




Projects:

BMXsticker

 This project contains analysis done for the webshop "bmxsticker.eu" This is a small business run by my father. The business sells stickers for numberplates used in BMX racing, as well as needed side plates. 
Before the queries run above were used, basic data cleansing was needed in the raw Excel file, since the file was quite a mess (sorry dad). Unnecessary columns were deleted and the variable "processtime" was created, since this is much harder to do in SQL


The "Analysis Orders BMXsticker.eu" file seen above contains the SQL queries used to further clean and manipulate the data gathered.

Visualisations of the resulting manipulated data can be found in the link below;

Bank Campaign
The "Bank Campaign Data" file also found above contains the SQL for analysing the marketing campaign of a bank. The source of the dataset can be found in the file. Visualisations in a Tableau dashboard of the data gathered by SQL can be found below;
