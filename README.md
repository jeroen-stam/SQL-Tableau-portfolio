# SQL-portfolio
Hello! thank you for checking out my repository containing solo projects for data analysis using SQL, and their visualisations using Tableau.



The "Analysis Orders BMXsticker.eu" file seen above contains the SQL queries used to clean and manipulate the data 






The "Bank Campaign Data" file also found above contains the SQL for analysing the marketing campaign of a bank. The source of the dataset can be found in the file. Visualisations in a Tableau dashboard of the data gathered by SQL can be found below;
