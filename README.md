# SQL/Tableau portfolio
Hello! thank you for checking out my repository containing solo projects for data analysis using SQL, and their visualisations using Tableau.




## Projects:

### **Stedin**

This analysis uses the publicly available "Stedin Kleinverbruiksdata 2024" to analyse first the amount of power connections for gas and electricity separately. After a study is conducted to rank the different municipalities in which Stedin is the network operator on their average yearly power usage per connection, again, seperately for gas and electricity. The visualisations of the analysis can be found in the linnk below:

### **BMXsticker**

 This project contains analysis done for the webshop "bmxsticker.eu" This is a small business run by my father. The business sells stickers for numberplates used in BMX racing, as well as needed side plates. 
Before the queries run above were used, basic data cleansing was needed in the raw Excel file, since the file was quite a mess (sorry dad). Unnecessary columns were deleted and the variable "processtime" was created, since this is much harder to do in SQL


The "Analysis Orders BMXsticker.eu" file seen above contains the SQL queries used to further clean and manipulate the data gathered.

Visualisations of the resulting manipulated data can be found in the link below;

### **Bank Campaign**

The "Bank Campaign Data" file also found above contains the SQL for analysing the marketing campaign of a bank. The source of the dataset can be found in the file. Visualisations in a Tableau dashboard of the data gathered by SQL can be found below;
